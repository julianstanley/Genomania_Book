# Pyrosequencing



### Key Points

#### Pyrosequencing:

* was the first of the high-throughput, **next-generation** sequencing technologies.
* uses **luciferase** to release light whenever a dNTP is added to a growing strand.
* uses beads and a picotitre plate to put one strand of DNA in one well.
* has a relatively high read length, around 500bp.

### Question Answers



1. Sanger sequencing is still commonly used today to validate short stretches of DNA, such as parts of the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria. It's still the most accurate way to sequence &lt;1kB pieces of DNA.
2. ddNTPs are 3'-deoxy, meaning they lack a 3'-OH on their ribose moiety that dNTPs have, therefore they are elongation-terminating. 
3. ddNTPs can be radiolabeled \(with phosphorous\) or florescent labeled. 
4. 1977.
