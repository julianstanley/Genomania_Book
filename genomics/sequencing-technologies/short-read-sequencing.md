### **Overview**

### **More Detail**

**Step 1. Library Preparation**

DNA is fragmented \(sonication?\) Fragments are then run through a series of PCR reactions to amplify the DNA and place adapters on the ends. Generally there's a "P5" adapter on one end, and a "P7" adapter on the other.   
  
**Step 2. Binding to the flow cell**

Each flow cell has pre-attached short oligos \(sequences of DNA\) that have the sequences that the P5 and P7 adapters can bind to.
