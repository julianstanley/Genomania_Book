# Sanger Sequencing

## Sanger Sequencing

#### Key Points, Sanger sequencing:

* was the first major method for DNA sequencing
* is sequencing by synthesis in which a ddNTP is used as a terminator
* has read lengths up to 1kb, is accurate, but relatively low-throughput
* can be read on a gel \(older\) or through a capillary \(more modern\)
